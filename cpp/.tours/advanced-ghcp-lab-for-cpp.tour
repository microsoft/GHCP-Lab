Using the extension \"VS Code Speech\" (Also recommended in workspace and should be installed) you can simply talk to VS Code with speech to text.

These comments will demand a cleanup in the future and get disregarded and become unrelevant.\r\n2. More importantly, comments with GHCP aren't iterable, meaning it's a one-shot completions attempt. If you get it wrong, you have to edit your comment and try again. When using the inline chat you can then reply with what needs to be fixed. Just think of how rare it is when you code things that work for the first time, the better you are explaining what you want to GHCP, the better GHCP will help you, sometimes it takes a few rounds of explanations, a.k.a. \"inline chat ;)\"",
