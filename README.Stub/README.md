# Github Copilot Lab

Welcome to the Github copilot (GHCP) lab.

This lab shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.

- At the end of this lab you will know the differences between Github Copilot chat, inline chat, and completions and when to use which one.
- You will learn about GHCP aliases and slash commands for GHCP Copilot Chat and inline.
- You will learn how to be more proficient with your completions and how to get it right on the first try ðŸ¥‡
- You will learn about the GHCP suggestions panel.
- How to utilize context to the fullest so that Github Copilot gives you what you want. 


Feel free to reach out with improvement suggestions, feedback, or anything that you may come up with to @Yomanor.


There are two tracks, the Typescript track and the dotNet** track.
Simply double click the workspace you want to work on from the file explorer.
 
Each workspace has recommended extensions that you need to install to be able to run the code, you can run those.


Pre-req:
Follow [https://aka.ms/copilot](aka.ms/copilot) install instructions

How to participate:
1. Clone / Unzip
2. Double click the relevant workspace
3. Install recommended extensions from the workspace
    3.1 If you don't want to run the code, CodeTour is the critical one
4. Start the tour by clicking on the Play button to the right of the tour title, on the bottom left CodeTour Panel.![Code tour starting place](image.png)
5. Then follow the next (or previous) buttons in the tour once you're done :)


** But I'm a DotNet developer, why would I use VS Code? 
  `Using VS Code is mandatory as it has the Code tour extension which guides you through the learning. The Code tour instructions aren't included in GHCP context If they were, you'd get completions to everything and be done in 3 minutes!`
