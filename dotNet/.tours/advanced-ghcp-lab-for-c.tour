This helps Copilot understand your formatting rules, indentation preferences, and style guidelines - avoiding those annoying style errors that break builds.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we've already configured instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that emphasize explicit types, proper exception handling, and C# best practices. This means from Chat mode onwards, Copilot will generate code that fits our project perfectly!"

This prompt demonstrates how you can guide users through a sequence of questions, keep track of their answers, and even branch to other files based on their responses.\n\n**Why is this powerful?**\n- You can orchestrate different scenarios and learning paths based on user input.\n- If a certain answer is given (like the number 42), you can reference a different prompt file (see how it refers to [PromptB](.github/prompts/PromptB.prompt.md)).\n- This enables you to build interactive, context-aware flows for onboarding, quizzes, or troubleshooting.\n\n**Try it out:**\n1. Open the prompt file and review the logic.\n2. Imagine how you could use this to create your own guided experiences.\n3. Think about how branching logic and file references can help you automate support, onboarding, or even code reviews!\n\nPro tip 1: You can chain multiple prompt files together, making your chat agent as smart (or witty) as you want!\n\nPro tip 2: You can quickly invoke a prompt by typing a slash `/` followed by the prompt name (e.g., `/Interactive-Chat`) in the chat side panel or even inline. This will autocomplete and execute the prompt instantly—no need to browse for the file!\n\nReady to build your own interactive chat flows? Give it a go! 🤖✨",

Let's harness the power of a custom AI agent!\n\nIn this step, we'll introduce the concept of a custom AI agent that can be tailored to your workflow, preferences, and even your team's unique needs.\n\nOpen the `tour-builder.chatmode.md` file. This is the very entity that helped build this tour!\n\n**Why use a custom agent?**\n- Automate repetitive tasks\n- Guide users through complex flows\n- Enforce best practices and standards\n- Provide contextual help and onboarding\n\nCustom agents can be as simple or as advanced as you need. They're the next step in making your development environment truly yours.\n\nTake a look at the file and see how you might start building your own!"
