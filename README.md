# GitHub Copilot Playground Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot (GHCP) Playground Workshop! üöÄ

This is a **subset** of the complete GitHub Copilot Lab available in the [main](https://github.com/microsoft/GHCP-Lab/) branch of this repository. The playground focuses on the **paradigm shift** of modern AI-assisted development.

For easier reading, you can preview this file as Markdown using `Ctrl+Shift+V`.

## What You'll Learn in This Playground

This focused workshop teaches you the **paradigm shift** from traditional step-by-step coding to **intent-driven development**:

- **The New Way**: Describe *what* you want through meaningful variable names and let GitHub Copilot figure out the *how*
- **Paradigm Shift**: Move from writing explicit algorithms to expressing intent through descriptive naming
- **Legacy Code Assessment**: Use Copilot to analyze technical debt and implement improvements
- **Context Mastery**: Learn how proper naming and context lead to better AI suggestions

*This playground should take **15-20 minutes** to complete.*

## Two Language Tracks Available

Choose your preferred track (or try both!):

- **[C# Track](./GHCP-dotNet.code-workspace)** - Using LINQ and .NET conventions
- **[TypeScript Track](./GHCP-Typescript.code-workspace)** - Using modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns

Each workspace includes pre-configured Copilot instructions and recommended extensions.

## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: The Paradigm Shift

Learn the new way of coding with AI assistance through 6 practical exercises

### Part 2: Legacy Code Assessment

Practice using Copilot for technical debt management:

- **Analyze TODOs** - Extract and prioritize technical debt
- **Implementation** - Use Agent mode to implement improvements

## Key Concepts You'll Practice

- **Intent-Driven Naming**: `var makeOfOldestCar` instead of manually implementing the logic
- **Copilot Completions**: Let AI suggest the implementation
- **Context Awareness**: How proper naming improves suggestions
- **Technical Debt**: Using Copilot for code analysis and improvement
